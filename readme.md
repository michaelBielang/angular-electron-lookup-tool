## Project members
- Bichlmeier Christoph [Master]: UI, Electron, Angular, LDAP, Auth
- Bielang Michael [Bachelor]: DB, ORM, API
- Schmid Steffen [Bachelor]: Testing, VPN


## Project description
A Tool to simplify the college LDAP search.

Users should not need to know long and complicated LDAP commands. This tool therefore will enable them to only type in e. g. a firstname, lastname, or the college email address or a combination of them to perform the actual lookup. This includes additional search limitations for study subject, faculty, gender, or degree (Bachelor or Master) as well as limitation onto a specific college or university. With given input, the tool will then automatically look for fitting identities in the Active Directories of a preset list of colleges and universities. If at first a connection is not possible or no search result was found, it will try to establish a vpn connection to said list of colleges and universities.
